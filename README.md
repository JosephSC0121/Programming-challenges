1.Fizz Buzz is a classic programming problem often used as a job interview question for beginner programmers. The problem goes like this:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
